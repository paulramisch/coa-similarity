# Coat of Arms data

The data here is missing due to legal and github restrictions. If you want to try to train a Convolutional Autoencoder or try PCA, t-SNE or UMAP from the architecture comparision, you can add a folder here with coat of arms `/coa_renamed`, with the script `create_training_data.py` you can create your training data csv in `/coa_csv`.
