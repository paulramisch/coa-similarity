# Coat of Arms similarity
Evaluation of different ML techniques to retrieve similar coat of arms to a querry image.

The repository consists out of three main parts:
1. A comparison of the four architectures PCA, t-SNE, UMAP and Convultional Autoencoder for this use case in the directory `architecture_comparison`
2. A trained Convolutional Autoencoder including a web app in the directory `cnn_model`
3. A trained CNN model to find the angle of coat of arms in scans in `rotation_model`
